##Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to help PyBer makers make better decisions like improving access to ride sharing servers and determine affordability for under served neighbourhood. The analysis will showcase the relationship between the type of the city  (rural, suburban and urban) with the number of drivers and rides.

##Summary
- Increasing the total number of total drivers in the suburbs and urban cities will help increase the total rides.
- Decreasing the average the fare ride in the rural and suburban cities will help increase affordability and increase the total rides.
- Decreasing the average fare driver Will also help increase affordability and will increase the total rides in the rural and suburban cities.
