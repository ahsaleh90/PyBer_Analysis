## Summary
- Increasing the total number of total drivers in the suburbs and urban cities will help increase the total rides.
- Decreasing the average the fare ride in the rural and suburban cities will help increase affordability and increase the total rides.
- Decreasing the average fare driver Will also help increase affordability and will increase the total rides in the rural and suburban cities.
